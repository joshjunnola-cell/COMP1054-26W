<!-- On your own, construct a page featuring the lyrics of a song that is particularly meaningful to you, featuring appropriate typography
and layout applied using CSS. Include a short paragraph or two about the song and perhaps a bit about the artist or band. Style the page 
in a way that reflects the album cover that features the song.

Use appropriate page-level sectioning elements to structure the page, and semantically-meaningful elements to mark up the content. Select 
two typefaces in the spirit of the typography employed in the song's album cover. Employ a variety of CSS selector types to add visual 
styles to the page. Use CSS-based text-sizing techniques and other typographic styles to make the page attractive. -->

                <p>I remember when I used to be innocent, ain't shit changed</p>
                <p>I'm a young black belligerent</p>
                <p>Child of an immigrant, lifestyle frivolous</p>
                <p>'Round here we keep bad company cah them people pay dividends</p>
                <p>What's the point of bein' rich when your family ain't?</p>
                <p>It's like flyin' first class on a crashin' plane</p>
                <p>Dinners with the same ****, just higher bills</p>
                <p>And all the models Himalayan, they got higher heels</p>

                <h4>Verse 1</h4> <!--VERSE 1-->
                <p>I had dreams of doin' architecture</p>
                <p>Or sittin' through a Harvard lecture</p>
                <p>How the fuck I end up bein' Harvey Specter?</p>
                <p>Young black art collector, I could take the pressure</p>
                <p>Had the scales, now suits that come made to measure</p>
                <p>I drew the thin line between love and hate</p>
                <p>Double date, what you drinkin'? Let me cut the games</p>
                <p>Backstabbin' man, I'd rather that you cut my face</p>
                <p>If I ain't charmin' to women, it's all the fuckin' snakes</p>
                <p>You idolize the girl, there's no way I wife her</p>
                <p>She only fucks with rich ****, that's the way I like it</p>
                <p>I can't fabricate the truth, it's just the way I write it</p>
                <p>You got points on your creative license</p>
                <p>Ask Rapz, that's a criminal graduatin' in civil law</p>
                <p>Nothin' ain't civil 'bout the Civil War</p>
                <p>Grip a four, Gryffindor, this'll have you lyin' on your chest</p>
                <p>I got 99 marks, I wasn't tryin' on my test</p>
                <p>I'm blessed (why?)</p>
                <p>Because the pasta is gamberoni, the watch is a classic Rollie</p>
                <p>The pussy is sacred, it's holy, like matrimony</p>
                <p>I'm payin' the alimony to numb all the acrimony</p>
                <p>The flight is to Santorini, the car is a Lamborghini</p>
                <p>The cheese, the cheddar, the mozzarella, the fettuccini the only aim</p>
                <p>Look at my ego in the daily life</p>
                <p>You see what happens when you got the fuckin' game in a vice</p>
                <p>We're all alone</p>

                <h4>Verse 2</h4> <!--VERSE 2-->
                <p>I got a message from a kid on Sunday mornin'</p>
                <p>Said he don't know what to do</p>
                <p>And that he's thinkin' of killin' himself</p>
                <p>Me and him got more in common than he thinks</p>
                <p>But I tell him to see a shrink, so I can go on and live with myself</p>
                <p>I knew that my life was a film</p>
                <p>From when I had to share a bed with my mum and I was pissin' myself</p>
                <p>I just want my flowers while I'm here</p>
                <p>So I can put them at the front of the grave</p>
                <p>That I've been diggin' myself</p>
                <p>I grew up in a two-bed flat with seven people livin' with me</p>
                <p>You don't know what I did for myself</p>
                <p>My mum's the one that gave me opportunities</p>
                <p>And put me in positions that I couldn't have pictured myself</p>
                <p>We're from Nigeria, Benin City, Sin City</p>
                <p>Don't know what it's like? Take a trip for yourself</p>
                <p>Poverty's killin' us, the government's killin' us</p>
                <p>If they ain't killin' us, then we're killin' ourselves</p>
                <p>I would die for the **** I love</p>
                <p>My life's full of plotholes, and I'm fillin' 'em up</p>
                <p>I told mummy, "I ain't nothin' like my father"</p>
                <p>I'ma show her there's a different definition to love</p>
                <p>I tell my fans we're all alone in this together</p>
                <p>You can trust me</p>
                <p>All the shit you been feelin', you're feelin' with me</p>
                <p>We all the took the wrong turns in different streets</p>
                <p>We all cry the same tears on different cheeks</p>
                <p>I got a message from a kid on Monday mornin'</p>
                <p>Said he's grateful I responded and he's feelin' at peace with himself</p>
                <p>Me and him got more in common than he thinks</p>
                <p>But I tell him it's nothin' big, so I can go on and live with myself</p>
                <p>I knew that God would cast me as the leader</p>
                <p>Somethin' special when he messaged me and told me that I saved his life</p>
                <p>In 23 years, I done so much wrong</p>
                <p>But in that moment, I just felt like I had made it right</p>

            <p>The album’s opener, “We’re All Alone,” sets the tone for the entire project. Dave reflects on
                corruption in Nigeria, his academic ambitions, his upbringing, and the loneliness that shaped him. He
                also speaks openly about helping fans who struggle with suicidal thoughts, showing how deeply he feels
                connected to the people who listen to him.</p>

            <p>The title <em>We’re All Alone In This Together</em> comes into focus here. The “we” refers to Dave and
                his fans — a reminder that the struggles he describes are shared experiences. Despite the heavy themes,
                the track ends on a lighter, more hopeful note, hinting at growth and resilience.</p>

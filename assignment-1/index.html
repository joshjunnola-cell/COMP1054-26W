                <p>I had dreams of doin' architecture</p>
                <p>Or sittin' through a Harvard lecture</p>
                <p>How the fuck I end up bein' Harvey Specter?</p>
                <p>Young black art collector, I could take the pressure</p>
                <p>Had the scales, now suits that come made to measure</p>
                <p>I drew the thin line between love and hate</p>
                <p>Double date, what you drinkin'? Let me cut the games</p>
                <p>Backstabbin' man, I'd rather that you cut my face</p>

                <p>I got a message from a kid on Sunday mornin'</p>
                <p>Said he don't know what to do</p>

                <p>Me and him got more in common than he thinks</p>
                <p>But I tell him to see a shrink, so I can go on and live with myself</p>
                <p>I knew that my life was a film</p>
                <p>From when I had to share a bed with my mum and I was pissin' myself</p>
                <p>I just want my flowers while I'm here</p>
                <p>So I can put them at the front of the grave</p>
                <p>That I've been diggin' myself</p>

                <p>My mum's the one that gave me opportunities</p>
                <p>And put me in positions that I couldn't have pictured myself</p>
                <p>We're from Nigeria, Benin City, Sin City</p>
                <p>Don't know what it's like? Take a trip for yourself</p>
                <p>Poverty's killin' us, the government's killin' us</p>
                <p>If they ain't killin' us, then we're killin' ourselves</p>
                <p>I would die for the **** I love</p>
                <p>My life's full of plotholes, and I'm fillin' 'em up</p>
                <p>I told mummy, "I ain't nothin' like my father"</p>

                <p>Me and him got more in common than he thinks</p>
                <p>But I tell him it's nothin' big, so I can go on and live with myself</p>
                <p>I knew that God would cast me as the leader</p>
                <p>Somethin' special when he messaged me and told me that I saved his life</p>
                <p>In 23 years, I done so much wrong</p>

            <h3>About the Song</h3><!-- All about the song -->
            <p>The album’s opener, “We’re All Alone,” sets the tone for the entire project. Dave reflects on
                corruption in Nigeria, his academic ambitions, his upbringing, and the loneliness that shaped him. He
                also speaks openly about helping fans who struggle with suicidal thoughts, showing how deeply he feels
                connected to the people who listen to him.</p>

            <p>The title <em>We’re All Alone In This Together</em> comes into focus here. The “we” refers to Dave and
                his fans — a reminder that the struggles he describes are shared experiences. Despite the heavy themes,
                the track ends on a lighter, more hopeful note, hinting at growth and resilience.</p>

            <h3>About the Album</h3><!-- All about the album -->
            <p>We’re All Alone In This Together is the sophomore studio album from Streatham, South West London rapper
                Dave, released on July 23, 2021. It follows his award winning debut studio album PSYCHODRAMA, which was
                released March 8, 2019.</p>

            <p style="font-size:1.2rem"><em>In a July 2021 interview with GQ Dave revealed:</em></p>

            <p>
                The album title is We’re All Alone In This Together. Hans Zimmer said it to me on FaceTime. He was like,
                “Dave, remember, we’re all alone in this together.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Following a 17-month hiatus, Dave dropped the singles bundle Titanium & Mercury on April 10th 2021 as a
                precursor to his sophomore album. He officially announced the album name and release date on July 5,
                2021. On July 9, Dave dropped the albums lead single “Clash” featuring fellow South London heavyweight
                Stormzy. On September 8th, Dave followed up with his second single, “Verdansk (Survival Mode)”
            </p>

            <p>
                The track list was revealed on July 14, 2021 and houses nine features from the likes of Stormzy, Wizkid,
                BOJ, Snoh Aalegra, and James Blake with surprise unlisted features from Fredo, Meekz Manny, Ghetts and
                Giggs on the fourth cut.
            </p>

            <p>
                Voyaging through twelve tracks, Dave finds exactly an hour to cover all corners: from flexing his gang
                ties, wealth and status as an exuberant 23-year old, to exploring the vibrancy and liveliness of his
                native Nigeria, to the sweet-and-sour perils of love, into deeper socio-political subjects such as war,
                domestic abuse, immigration and youth violence.
            </p>

            <p>
                A majority of the album pays homage to his loving mother, Juliet – to which he litters smart references
                and themes of the motion pictures around, even recruiting British Oscar winning actor Daniel Kaluuya to
                additional vocals on the outros. He had revealed after the album had been released that he is working on
                a biographical movie of his mother and this album plays as the soundtrack.

            <h3>About Dave</h3><!-- About Dave! -->
            <p>
                Dave (aka <strong>Santan Dave</strong>) was born David Omoregie in the Brixton area of South London in
                1998, later moving
                to Streatham. Growing up, he was inspired to pursue art in some form. Taking cues from his older
                brothers, he initially tried his hand at animation before moving on to piano; he finally settled on
                becoming a fully fledged MC. Unfortunately, his brothers ended up serving lengthy prison sentences. To
                cope with the drastic alteration in their lives, Dave burrowed even deeper into his music and developed
                a socially aware form of wordplay that set him apart from his peers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite starting to write bars around the age of ten, it wasn't until six years later that Dave would
                make his first appearance, freestyling on an underground U.K. rap channel Bl@ckbox, in 2015. In January
                of the following year, Dave returned with his first music video/single "JKYL+HYD," cementing his
                reputation for deep subject matter and ambitious lyrics. In the following months, Dave delivered two key
                freestyles on BBC Radio 1. The first was on Semtex's 1Xtra show and the second was on 's Fire in the
                Booth. A number of singles followed, including a standout collaboration with West London's own rising
                star on "Thiago Silva." By September, Dave was ready to deliver his first EP, Six Paths. The release was
                a success in its own right but got even more attention when Canadian rapper remixed the single "Wanna
                Know," bringing Dave's sound to an American audience.

        <h4>My Thoughts</h4> <!-- My thoughts, about the artist/song -->
        <section>
            <p>
                This honestly wasnt the first song I wanted to choose off of the album. It is one of my favourites
                though,
                it is a phenomenal album. I wanted to choose Heart Attack by Dave, if you have 10 minutes (I know quite
                long
                for songs nowadays/in general) to put aside. I highly suggest it if you enjoy songs where you can search
                for
                more meaning in the lyrics, lots of double entendres. He really is so talented! Truly a poet when he
                wants
                to be and isn't just going for the sounds that will get a lot of listens. I didn't choose Heart Attack
                because of how long it is, I didn't want to have such a long page to try to work around.
            </p>

            <p>
                With that aside. I have always found a love in Dave's music as he is able to so often put his ego aside
                and open up to the listener. He always does a great job relating back to the listener as well, you can
                tell
                his writing is very intentional. In this song at first it seems like it will be a pretty normal rap song
                nowadays, talking about partying, drugs, etc. He also speaks on all of his blessings and everything he's
                gotten but that we're still all alone. Then about half-way through it switches up and starts
                taking a lot more of an introspective approach first speaking on how Dave had gotten a message from a
                fan contemplating suicide. He talks about what his reaction was and how that made him feel, stating they
                had more in common than he knows.
